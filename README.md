AutoLeader
==========

WoW addon that automatically promotes someone to leader in arena. This is useful for when you play with certain people who always require leader.

### How to use

Once in a party, right click their frame and click "Auto Leader". Do the same thing again to disable giving auto leader to that person.

### Who made it?

I go by a lot of WoW names, but you might know me as creamcup, mixup, dotup.
