AutoLeader
==========

WoW addon that automatically promotes someone to leader in arena. This is useful for when you play with certain people who always require leader.

### How to use

Once in a party, right click their frame and click "Auto Leader". You will get a confirmation in the chat that it is enabled for that person.

Do the same thing again to disable giving auto leader to that person.
